    content: `<p>Long gone are the days where most of us were distrustful of internet or phone banking. Originally
      seen as risky, many of us now think nothing of paying via tap-and-go, BPay or PayPal. Electronic
      banking has become the go-to convenience for so many people, too busy in their day-to-day lives
      to manage a trip to pay bills directly anymore.</p>
  <p>But did you have any idea how often these databases and storage facilities were breached?! At a
      cursory search, Wikipedia showed me a listing of all hacks and breaches. Whether it was an
      intentional inside leak, or hacking, from data being sold to a third party, or just negligence
      and accidentally publishing client&rsquo;s details.</p>
  <p>Some of the most outstanding mentions were the Bank of America, NASDAQ, the IRS, American
      Express, and Citigroup.</p>

          breaches</a></p>
  <p>The numbers of records exposed is quite concerning. And the table above just shows select banking
      breaches. There were entire Government sites infiltrated. If they contained personal banking
      information on the population, that would also contribute to the banking data spewed out.
      Airlines and hotels with booking confirmations and bank account details, even if saved
      temporarily until your flight or hotel stay, are still vulnerable during that time out of your
      hands.</p>
  <p>All it took for Chile was for one employee to click on a link in a spam email. The malicious file
      sent via an Office document, opened a backdoor into the banks network resulting in all branches
      of the country's largest three banks shutting down completely. This was not long after
      Chile&rsquo;s network was breached in an attempt to completely disrupt the nation&rsquo;s
      banking.</p>

  <p>For Bangladesh, having nearly $100 million stolen from their Central Bank hit the nation hard in
      2016. Soon after, Russia confirmed hackers had stolen over $31 million from their Central Bank
      as well.</p>
  <p>The Boston Consulting Group found financial firms were 300 times more likely to be attacked than
      other firms, with Mastercard reporting in 2019 that there were over 460 000 attempts to breach
      each day.</p>
  <p>This report highlighted the ability of banks and financial institutions to detect and contain a
      cyber attack rather than prevent them in the first place.</p>

  <p>Now that the shift away from cash and toward electronic banking due to Covid-19 has a majority of
      the world&rsquo;s population sticking to electronic options, attempts to breach networks have
      intensified. The thieves are targeting the increased vulnerabilities.</p>

  <p>A year ago the Big 4 in Australia were compromised. Banking details linked to PayID were all
      breached. Westpac did not even realise this breach had occurred until another institution
      contacted them. Once a second party realised what was happening, they alerted the bank, who only
      then could investigate and begin securing customer&rsquo;s funds.</p>

  <p>And the NAB specifically reported being hit by millions of cyber attacks per day. The increase of
      attacks by 78% mid year led to 33% more losses being reported. The claim in the NAB report was
      also that some of the cyber crime was state-sponsored as well, just to obtain information on
      Australians.</p>
  <p>However they also showed syndicates attempting to slow down bank&rsquo;s systems to gain
      financial information. We won&rsquo;t go into DDoS attacks and what they can do to systems. But
      large scale attacks can slow processing speeds so far that transactions in and out of account
      will come to a standstill.</p>

  <p>Back in May a report showed ransomware attacks against banks had increased nine-fold earlier in
      2020. It reported attacks on banks had actually spiked 238%. 238! Quite a few of the respondents
      also reported the attacks had become much more sophisticated over the past 12 months, with many
      reporting an attack that was designed purely to elicit damage, rather than obtain any ransom
      money.</p>

  <p>In fact, an interview with hacker Phineas Phisher revealed he &ldquo;lived&rdquo; in banks
      networks for months before being detected. Phineas is a private individual whose
      anti-capitalist, anti-surveillance views prompted him to hack the Italian IT company Hacking
      Team, as well as Anglo-German company Gamma Group. These corporations sell software to enable
      governments to gather data and information on, and from, their citizens.</p>
  <p>The most worrying part of the interview was that Phineas did not use any sophisticated tools,
      only off-the-shelf crimeware. The investigation into the Cayman National Isle of Man Bank found
      a breach that Phineas claimed was not actually his. His claim was that it was a coincidence, and
      that someone else was simultaneously hacking the bank. The less sophisticated and experienced
      criminal was exposed, revealing the Phineas Phisher hack from months prior.</p>

          a bank got hacked</a></p>
  <p>What we can all learn from this is that there are large corporations out there, supplying
      software to countries so they can surveil their own inhabitants as well as other countries, AND
      that competent hackers don&rsquo;t even need that type of software to be able to hack into our
      data.</p>
  <p>So while I am not advocating the mass withdrawal of cash that is prompting countries to have
      shortages of notes, perhaps keep in the back of your mind that electronically speaking, our
      money is not entirely safe either. We may be looking at governments preferring a cashless
      society, but is that going to be safe enough? Is there going to be a guarantee that my hard
      earned income is only accessible by me? Cyber security is becoming a much larger field. I think
      perhaps an extremely necessary one. And could it lead to individuals having to hire their own
      cyber consultants before deciding on which bank to hold funds? If governments are going to push
      for cashless societies, they should secure them.</p>`,

    content: `<p>There has been a lot of action with banks lately in Australia, some good, some not so good, but
      all not related to interest rates. So if interest rates bore you, or that&rsquo;s all you see
      when you search for banking news on Google, check out the points below to see if your bank has
      made major changes.</p>
  <h3>ANZ to close 15 branches</h3>
  <p>Mostly regional branches, there will be 15 closed throughout New South Wales, Victoria and
      Western Australia. This makes 146 since the start of 2020, and will this time leave 54 people
      unemployed.</p>
  <p>Check the article below to see if these closures affect you:</p>

          bank to close 15 more branches in NSW, Vic, WA</a></p>
  <h3>Westpac closures</h3>
  <p>Westpac are following the footsteps of ANZ and closing 48 branches. However this still leaves
      them with the second-most number of branches throughout Australia. The banks involved in this
      include Bank SA, St George, Bank of Melbourne and Westpac branches, with over half being BOM
      branches.</p>
  <p>300 jobs will be relocated, and the closures will mostly affect branches that are within 5km of
      another branch, or where demand has fallen below the ability to staff branches.</p>

  <h3>Faster home loans</h3>
  <p>The Big 4 have announced a dramatic cut in wait times for home loan approvals. Some cite one day
      for regular income earners, and most claim to have simple home loans approved within two days.
  </p>
  <p>Going through a broker will slightly increase processing times, but the banks are wanting to
      streamline and improve these procedures even more.</p>

  <h3>Citi up for sale</h3>
  <p>Coming in fifth behind the Big 4 banks, Citigroup are putting their consumer banking business up
      for sale. The ACCC have already warned the Big 4 that if they do consider put in an offer for
      the first foreign bank to be granted a license to trade in Australia, they would consider
      blocking the deal.</p>
  <img src="/images/blog/banking-updates-april-2021-img-2.jpg"
      alt="Citi Building" width="900" height="1125">
  <p>Citi are looking to move away from consumer banking and focus more on investment and commercial
      banking. The sale will affect Citi&rsquo;s holdings in Australia, India, Bahrain, China,
      Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and
      Vietnam.</p>

  <h3>ASIC taking Westpac to court</h3>
  <p>Although there are ongoing class action, ASIC is now starting civil proceedings against Westpac
      over Consumer Credit Insurance (CCI). The allegation is that CCI was charged to clients that
      never agreed to purchase it:</p>

          four banks dragged to court over consumer credit insurance 'rort'</a></p>
  <p>There are also claims being made that the insurance was still charged to customers after their
      loans had been completely paid off, and that some were sold the CCI even if they were ineligible
      to claim under their policy.</p>
  <img src="/images/blog/banking-updates-april-2021-img-3.jpg"
      alt="Piggy Bank Wearing Mask" width="900" height="600">
  <p>So overall, please check your insurances, your branch closures, and perhaps see if your home loan
      application should be lodged now to avoid lengthy waiting periods.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Banking institutions have a long past, and there are options. You do not have to use a
                        &ldquo;bank&rdquo; but perhaps might prefer a credit union. What is the difference?</p>
    <p>Banks originated as <strong>Merchant Banks</strong> and were invented by grain and cloth
                        merchants in the Middle Ages. It became increasingly necessary to have to store valuables,
                        whether they were assets or tradable goods, in a secure location to be &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo;
                        later. Eventually money could be lent to someone based on the premise their crop would yield the
                        similar amount next harvest. Currently, these have evolved into Investment Banks or Accepting
                        and Issuing Houses and usually manage portfolios, or investment concerns and merger/acquisition
                        counsel.</p>

    <p><strong>Commercial Banks</strong> are the kind we are most used to seeing. They provide general
                        services to the public, including savings accounts and loans. They can issue and clear cheques,
                        perhaps provide safe deposit boxes, maybe offer credit or debit cards, and deal in foreign
                        exchange transactions.</p>
    <p>Commercial Banks will also have members of the public as customers as well as corporations. These
                        are primarily the major banks in any region and are regulated by the country&rsquo;s Central
                        Bank, or Reserve Bank.</p>
    <p><strong>Central Banks</strong>, Reserve Banks, or Monetary Authority oversee a country&rsquo;s
                        banking system. They manage the money for their nations, whether through policies or setting
                        interest rates, by regulating the Commercial Banks, and much more. These are the banks that will
                        be able to lend money to governments, and other banks, as well as managing gold reserves and
                        control the money supply for the country.</p>

    <p>The Amsterdamsche Wisselbank in 1609, was a forerunner to Central Banks was able to receive
                        foreign and local money, deducted their fees, and credited the customer with the balance in
                        their books. This was bank money and was safe from fire or robbery as it was secured by the
                        city, and it could be transferred to another person. The Bank of Amsterdam gave receipts for
                        gold and silver bullion stored, and charged a nominal fee for this rental of bank space.</p>

    <p><strong>A Building Society</strong> is owned by its members, and began as far back as the 18th
                        Century. Birmingham was growing rapidly and a group was formed (Ketley&rsquo;s Building Society)
                        whereby members would pay monthly into a central fund which was then used to finance building
                        houses for members. This in turn was used as collateral to enable more funds to be obtained,
                        giving the members the ability to build more houses. These were based in taverns mostly, and
                        Ketley&rsquo;s in particular was formed in 1775.</p>
    <p><strong>Mutual Savings Banks</strong> emerged at a similar time, and was again owned by its
                        members who paid into a central fund. In 1810 the Savings and Friendly Society was founded by
                        Reverend Duncan in Scotland. His primary motivation was to encourage his congregation to become
                        thrifty and save money.</p>

    <p><strong>Credit Unions</strong> are not only owned by its members, and they vote for the head of
                        their bank, but the members must share a common bond. They may belong to a similar location,
                        employer, or profession. These not for profit institutions originally served poorer people,
                        middle class workers and sometimes urban and rural communities.</p>

    <p>Beginning in Germany in the 1850s, and were based on the cooperative movement that was finding
                        success in other markets. Some had begun as a way to feed families that might not have been able
                        to afford without assistance. Mostly they have evolved into establishments worldwide that are
                        more resilient in the face of adversity , whether hurricanes or financial collapses. In Japan in
                        the 19th Century village unions were able to lend money with all members bearing the cost in
                        case of default. While Japan operated under Sakoku, and was isolated from the rest of the world,
                        the invention of a cooperative was not influenced by other countries or established practices
                        overseas. The ability to form groups that helped each other strive seems to be inherent and
                        universal.</p>

    <p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were created in 1944. After World War II the
                        Bretton Woods system established rules for financial relations between the US, Canada,
                        Australia, most of Europe and Japan. These led to commercial banks lending to third world
                        countries.</p>
    <p>The <strong>World Bank</strong> provides loans to low and middle income countries that may want
                        to fund advancements, and is actually the World Bank Group, comprised of five international
                        organisations</p>
    <p>The <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> consists of 189 countries working together to
                        reduce poverty and secure financial stability. They also operate on a type of cooperative system
                        where countries can borrow against funds that are pooled by all member countries.</p>
    <p>So there we have it, there&rsquo;s your bank where you can pop in and cash a cheque, and
                        there&rsquo;s a heap more! You can now tell the difference between all types of banks, and
                        perhaps it may make you rethink which type you give your business to.</p>

    content: `<p>Running a business means you will be dealing with money every day. Therefore, you will need a
                        reliable cash-in-transit (CIT) service provider who can secure your takings and deliver them to
                        the bank on time. There are many CIT firms in the market, but choosing the right fit is vital in
                        order to maintain total cash security.</p>
    <p>A good CIT service provider organizes cash pickup and collection schedules that help improve
                        efficiency, focus, and company productivity. But if you&rsquo;re new to the concept of CIT, the
                        models of cash transport can be a little confusing. It is important to be able to differentiate
                        these models to help you understand what is best for your company.</p>
    <p>There are two types of guards or couriers in the cash-in-transit industry: <strong>unarmed guards
                            and armed guards</strong>. The infographic below presents the pros and cons of each model to
                        help you weigh out your options.</p>

                        alt="Differences Between... CIT Models Infographics" width="900" height="600">
    <p>Cash-in-transit companies ensure the safest transport of money, and each one has a unique
                        approach to getting things done. Most CIT providers utilise marked vehicles that are usually
                        bulletproof, while others use covert or soft-skinned vehicles to move money discreetly. Check
                        out the infographic below for the pros and cons of each model.</p>

                        alt="Differences Between... CIT Models Infographics" width="900" height="600">
    <p>Whichever CIT model you choose, make sure that you have assessed the company based on its length
                        of service and experience. You may also browse their website, read client reviews, and ask other
                        business owners for recommendations to know if they are reliable enough. Despite many options,
                        you will know when it&rsquo;s right as you get to work with them along the way.</p>

    content: `<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were some men, who sold things. Let&rsquo;s call them
                        merchants. And these merchants travelled between big, vast cities, carrying their goods and
                        trying to sell them to support their families.</p>
    <p>One day, a very smart merchant thought maybe he could give grains and seeds to a farmer, and
                        perhaps when the grain grew up and was harvested, they could repay the seeds. That meant that
                        they could keep lending out seeds over and over again. Not the same seeds of course, as they had
                        been planted, grown and harvested. But they never had to get more grains for their lending as
                        they kept being repaid.</p>
    <p>And the merchants and the farmers lived happily ever after.</p>
    <p>These transactions took place around 2000BC in Assyria and Sumeria. Eventually Greece would take
                        over as the premier banking authority and lenders would base themselves in temples, handing out
                        loans and accepting deposits to hold for later withdrawal.</p>

    <p>Excavations from 8000BC have divulged recording tokens that were used to tally produce. And the
                        Code of Hammurabi, a clay tablet from a Babylonian city-state created in the late 1700s BC,
                        listed 282 rules and laws including those related to baking practices.</p>
    <p>The temple was usually located very centrally in the city-states of Babylon, and this made them
                        very useful as trading centres, around 2300BC. At the same time in the 2000s BC that the
                        merchants were lending grain, palaces were as well, just perhaps less often. And there are clay
                        tablets documenting agreements for deposits. Gold was held in the temple, and the people making
                        the deposit were required toy pay one sixtieth of the deposit as payment for holding the gold.
                    </p>
    <p>Eventually there are records of &ldquo;lending houses&rdquo; in 1000BC tablets, and the largest
                        depository in Asia was the Temple of Artemis. Mark Anthony was said to have stolen from the
                        temple on one occasion, and it was a depository for Aristotle, Caesar, Plutarch and Xenophon.
                    </p>

                        saw branches in a network developed, and all the regional accounts were recorded in the central
                        bank at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Roman banking system moved from temples to be held in private depositories instead.
                        A public bank was created around 325BC, and for Plebeians in debt, who were required to borrow
                        money, anyone who had security to provide against the loan were provided services by a
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>The banking houses in ancient Rome had money lenders set up benches in enclosed courtyards. These
                        lenders had their benches (banca) they would trade from, and in the cases where they did not
                        perform well, their bench was broken (rotta) - banca rotta eventually being more recognisable as

                        note stating it is stored there.</p>
                    <p>By the 20th Century we have the modern banks that provide personal banking, mortgages and loans,
                        and credit cards. Retail banks were initially built on the main streets of towns so you could
                        easily withdraw funds while doing your weekly shopping. They are still located in major centres
                        and shopping centres.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of banking is the interest applied to repayments. Initially this practice, called
                        usury, was forbidden for Christians. It was a sin. However, Jewish people, displaced by Spanish
                        persecution, moved and brought with them practices from the Middle and Far East. The silk and
                        trade routes had long been funded by lenders, and the Jewish people applied these processes to
                        general loans.</p>

                    <p>They were able to trade in piazza&rsquo;s in Italy, whereas the Christian&rsquo;s could not, so
                        set their benches up in public spaces. They also arranged for the sale of the crop their grain
                        loans would be responsible for.</p>
                    <p>Eventually billettes were written out as a formal letter of exchange for holding money at the
                        banca. Other documents used in early banking were ones redeemed at a trade fair. A person could
                        deposit funds at one fair, obtain a document, and withdraw the funds at another fair, or at the
                        same fair at a future date.</p>
                    <p>1156 saw the oldest foreign exchange contract. Two brothers in Genoa borrowed 115 Genoese pounds
                        and agreed to pay back the bank in Constantinople 460 bezants a month after arriving in
                        Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Banks have had such a long history and have always had that entwined with money. If you read our
                        series on the history of money, many of these dates and places certainly correspond with each
                        other. There is always more to learn, and if you are interested, you can research the history of
                        banks in most continents around the world.</p>

    content: `<p>Cash-in-transit (CIT) is largely defined as the physical transfer of banknotes, coins, cheques,
                       and other valuable items from one location to another. It is popular among many corporations, as
                       it has been serving them for the longest time by providing the most secure solutions in moving

                       wondered how the cash-in-transit service industry started? Did you know that courier companies
                       in Australia stretch back as far as camel trains that carried goods and supplies throughout the

    content: `<p>This has been one of the most unpredictable years that we have all gone through.</p>
                   <p>I distinctly remember talking in the office earlier in the year and we were all debating if Covid
                       was going to be an issue. Some offices nearby were closing down, and a lot of our clients were
                       asking if there would be changes with collections. I was asked if I was going to write an
                       article about it, and I clearly had to stop and think if I would or not. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if
                       this was a big enough event to write about.</p>
                   <p class="link-new-tab">Read the original article here: <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                           href="https://supplychainchannel.co/will-your-company-shut-down-for-covid-19/">Will your
                           company shut down for Covid-19?</a></p>
                   <p>Well, now I know better.</p>
                   <p>We did stay in our offices as long as possible, and until severe restrictions were put in place
                       in Adelaide, we maintained our routines, supporting our couriers on the road for our clients.
                   </p>
                   <p>Throughout the entire year, we were an essential service, looking after the banking collections
                       for every other essential service that had to stay open. Our couriers had to adapt, in some
                       cases to testing each time they changed suburbs, or replacing gloves with each attendance.</p>
                   <p>Like many other small businesses, we lost a lot of our business. So many of our clients suspended
                       and held their collections until we all knew what was going on. We were extremely lucky to have
                       bought new office space prior to Covid, and so we could do manual labour to help rebuild the
                       building if we weren&rsquo;t needed to support the couriers.</p>
                   <p>When I returned to SecureCash properly, I was pretty hesitant to go back onto Linkedin. I thought
                       I would see devastating news everywhere. But I saw so much support for others.</p>
                   <p>Retail businesses still growing. People helping each other find work. It was a pleasure to get
                       back to my networking (albeit in online only).</p>
                   <p>So this Christmas, our end of year get together meant so much more to all of us here at
                       SecureCash. Our wonderful clients came back to us as soon as they could. And everyone that had
                       ongoing collections through Covid understood when we had to restrict days as couriers lost
                       hours, and days sometimes, of work.</p>
                   <p>We have already had our end of year celebration, and enjoyed a lovely dinner together with our
                       families. But we will likely still have many more mini celebrations before the end of the year.
                       We are all so grateful to have survived Covid, to still be employed (by wonderful people), to
                       still have our fantastic clients with us. There is so much to be grateful for.</p>

                   <p>I think we all know how lucky we were to find each other. We all appreciate what each other can
                       do, we know how to push ourselves forward and we do expect the best from each other because we
                       know we&rsquo;re all committed to SecureCash.</p>
                   <p>I do realise how absolutely sappy this all sounds, but this is the Christmas to do it! Be sappy.
                       Tell each other how important you are. So many people passed away this year and do not get to
                       tell anyone how much they were loved. So many people were laid off or made redundant, and are
                       not very happy at all this time of year.</p>
                   <p>Charities are going to have a hard time this Christmas. When they were already struggling to
                       support the low and middle income earners that needed a hand, having such limited resources and
                       access to fundraising throughout 2020, will mean a real stretch this year.</p>
                   <p>Thank you to all of our clients for your support and understanding throughout 2020. We truly
                       appreciate your loyalty, your communication, and hope you have a fantastic holiday season.</p>
                   <p>Thank you to all of our couriers and partners that assisted with collections and deliveries. We
                       are so glad you work with us to help our clients have their money safely transported.</p>
                   <p>Thank you to all the families that supported everyone who worked for or with SecureCash. We know
                       how much you have to do with how well we work.</p>
                   <p>Thank you to everyone in our offices, no matter where we had to work from through 2020. The hard
                       work that went into learning new tasks, adapting to new routines, or driving much further to get
                       to a makeshift office was all noticed and appreciated.</p>

                   <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Recently the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced an
                           interest rate drop. Even if you do not own stocks and shares, if you do not earn millions
                           each year, this still has an effect on you. If we run into negative rates, you may have to
                           pay the bank to store your money.</strong></p>
                   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Interest rates and what they are there for.</h3>
                   <p>Banks serve multiple purposes. You can store your money there, or save, and you can take out a
                       loan, or borrow. Both of these are not free for both parties. To store your money in the bank,
                       and save it, the bank will pay you a &ldquo;fee&rdquo;. A percentage of your money is calculated
                       and paid back to you regularly. This is your interest that you earn on savings.</p>
                   <p>This money that is stored in the bank, is used to fund loans. If someone takes out a loan (to
                       build a house, buy a car, or whatever), they are given the money and have to pay it back to the
                       bank, along with the &ldquo;fee&rdquo; involved. The cost of borrowing this money is the
                       interest calculated on the amount borrowed (the principal).</p>
                   <p><strong><a target="_blank"

                               rel="noopener">https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-interest-rates-and-how-do-they-work-3305855</a></strong>
                   </p>
                   <p>With me so far? Pretty easy steps to here: save money and be rewarded, or borrow money and pay
                       for that privilege.</p>
                   <h3 style="text-align:center;">High versus Low Interest Rates</h3>
                   <p>When interest rates are high it will have an effect on what people do with their money. People
                       who save money in the bank will earn more interest on their deposits. People who take out a
                       loan, will have to pay more in return. Less loans are taken out in this instance as the amount
                       repayable is too expensive and they cannot justify the repayment amount. However, more people
                       save money as they will be earning more from their bank.</p>
                   <p>When interest rates are low, it stands to reason the opposite happens. People tend to take out
                       more loans to begin businesses or build houses. The amount repaid is so low, more people can
                       afford the repayment total. Savings earn less interest though, so people may not keep their
                       money in the bank, but rather might spend more and have cash on hand.</p>
                   <p>Still with me? It&rsquo;s still relatively black and white. We&rsquo;re about to go grey.</p>
                   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Negative interest rates</h3>
                   <p>This will have the effect on the banking industry of reversing everything I just said.</p>
                   <p>A negative interest rate means that when you have any savings in your bank, you have to pay them
                       to store the funds. If you borrow money, the bank will end up paying you, in a way.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>If you are used to having all your funds in your account and swiping or paying electronically
                       everywhere you go, not only will you be paying the transaction fees for each usage, you may end
                       up paying to store the money in the first place. So you will end up paying the bank twice to use
                       your own income.</p>
                   <p></p>

                       height="600">
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">However if you borrow funds, again for whatever purpose - building,
                       car, holiday) your lower interest rate might mean that when you perhaps borrow $200000 to build
                       a house, you might only repay $170000 of it.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap"><strong><a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                               href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-31/interest-rate-cut-to-negative-territory/12832066">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-31/interest-rate-cut-to-negative-territory/12832066</a></strong>
                   </p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">Now if this does happen, there are consequences. If people are not
                       leaving their money in the bank (remember right back at the beginning? That money is what is
                       used to fund loans), there is no money made on the lending, and as it costs the banks so much
                       (billions), it would be better not to lend out money at all. We end up with no one building
                       houses, no one buying cars.</p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">People also become wary of spending at all. A hoarding mentality sets
                       in and people prefer to keep cash on hand rather than fork it over. The uncertainty from stable,
                       reliable banks flipping their purposes leads to a concern over savings and ability to retire
                       comfortably.&nbsp; However, if you are not overly concerned with saving, you are now free to
                       spend your money on what you need, without having to pay the bank higher fees to store your
                       income.</p>

                   </p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">There are a few countries that are experimenting with negative interest
                       rates to boost their economies. Switzerland, Denmark and Japan all have negative interest rates
                       set by their Central Banks. The fees in Switzerland, if nowhere else, were not passed onto their
                       customers, and banks had to absorb the cost of housing funds.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">Banks themselves have to borrow money from the Central Bank in their
                       country. So in Australia, that is the Reserve Bank. This is why their interest rate setting
                       matters. They say how much the smaller banks have to pay to store money in the larger bank. Then
                       the smaller banks charge a similar amount to us, their customers. But that can send us off on
                       another tangent and we&rsquo;ve already covered a lot for today.</p>
                   <p class="blog-content-wrap">If you have not had to delve into interest rates before, I hope this
                       explains a lot and clears up some terminology for you. If you already know about them, thanks
                       for reading. It looks like it will be an interesting time in banking.</p>

    content: `<p>If there&rsquo;s anything at all you need to know about the SecureCash Head Office, it&rsquo;s
                        that we like to have fun. There are so many things that we do together, after hours, in
                        different groups or teams, but inside the office, during business hours, we still like a laugh.
                    </p>
                    <p>As soon as a particular Manager hears about your greatest fear, there will be small, rubber or
                        plastic ones in your desk, or under your chair&hellip; you will see them everywhere. One of our
                        former colleagues was basically hooked into the &lsquo;net and would immediately produce a meme
                        or video that encapsulated whatever had been said or typed.</p>
                    <p>And we all Uber Friday. We have had office spaces that had very little nearby for choices for
                        lunch. So one day, one of us Ubered lunch and that was that. Every Friday, everyone Ubers their
                        lunch. It might not all even be at the same time, but we invariably have lunch delivered no
                        matter what else is going on at work that day. If you don&rsquo;t order, wow! You are persona
                        non grata for the afternoon. Just kidding! We will only talk laughingly about the person who
                        used to be one of us and has now betrayed us.</p>
                    <p>There have been competitions to see who&rsquo;s order was delivered first if multiple people
                        ordered at the same time. Everyone sits and deliberates for the longest time about what they
                        feel like eating that day. But as soon as the order button is hit, that&rsquo;s it. Everyone is
                        informed of everyone else placing the order and that is our sole focus until everyone has
                        ordered lunch.</p>

                    <p>There have been rating systems in place so you can see what local restaurants others had enjoyed
                        and recommended to each other. We moved offices recently and didn&rsquo;t know many of the local
                        food establishments. A spreadsheet was set up, access given to everyone, and now we rate the
                        food delivered, as well as comment on what in particular we liked about it.</p>
                    <p>Until we moved offices, we BBQ&rsquo;d on Wednesdays. No particular reason, but everyone brought
                        along something to contribute, and we enjoyed a joint lunch together. If you didn&rsquo;t or
                        couldn&rsquo;t bring anything, you were cooking or cleaning up. Everyone pitched in so we could
                        enjoy it all together.</p>
                    <p>Aside from physically being together and having joint lunches throughout the week, we talk often
                        on Messenger. If we are out and about and see something we know another member collects or is
                        quite interested in, we send a link or post a picture. We have Facebook groups as well and will
                        post in those frequently. We use Hangouts at work, and this will also spill over into after
                        hours conversations.</p>
                    <p>Everyone is quite aware of who has children, and of what age, whether they are busy or away, and
                        we know if we expect not to hear back from someone if we post. No one gets offended that a
                        certain person doesn&rsquo;t reply or joke back.</p>
                    <p>We have pets in the office. Often. Every Tuesday a particular Staffie visited us and hung out for
                        the day. If we work from our business owner&rsquo;s house, there is a German Shepherd, an Akita
                        and a Siamese that keep us company.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve lost count of the times we&rsquo;ve helped each other out. Whether it&rsquo;s advice,
                        an ear to listen, a sounding board required, or more severe times and helped find lost pets. If
                        you need a contact somewhere, or want a reference, once you mention anything to the team,
                        whoever can help will pipe up.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s all aside from the help we give each other at work. We will always step up when
                        someone is unsure how to proceed, or if we have experience with something that our colleague is
                        learning. If it comes to massive, important jobs, we break up the tasks into manageable chunks
                        and all take part.</p>
                    <p>Being friends after hours means we are all comfortable leaning on each other at work. We know how
                        best to support each other, and we know what everyone is going through. So if their workload
                        increases and we know they just aren&rsquo;t quite there themselves, we jump in. At any time if
                        anyone takes leave or is unwell, there are so many of us that can cross over to their role and
                        look after their team. The other employees are all used to us all anyway, and we can manage
                        whichever team needs us at the time.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s tricky balancing friendships at work, but we&rsquo;ve employed the right people. We
                        can still take direction, and we work hard, but we know when to draw the line and when to be
                        relaxed instead of professional. There&rsquo;s so much psychology to working in an office!</p>

    content: `<p>When I was at University, I learned about paradigm shifts. Society or groups of people have ways
                of thinking about things, and these socially acceptable processes are known as paradigms.</p>
            <p class="link-new-tab">Read More: <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions">Thomas
                    Kuhn: the man who changed the way the world looked at science</a></p>
            <p>If you think about going shopping, you know you should be a bit more polite when out in public,
                giving way to mothers that seem to have 18 children hanging off them and a wonky trolley. Smile
                and wait for them to pass. You can now checkout yourself and we know to wait politely in a queue
                and not cut in.</p>
            <p>Now, a shift in paradigms occurs when you have to learn a new way of doing things. So with Covid,
                we all had to follow the rules in each store and only stand on the X on the floor, or remain
                1.5m from the person in front. This paradigm shift was to protect each other from the spread of
                the virus. Other shifts have occurred because people discovered a better way to do things. Or
                they wanted to be a bit different from everyone else.</p>
            <p>So paradigm shifts are just a part of the world, and used to happen all the time. As society grew
                and developed, our customs all changed and we adapted to the new procedure so that we could fit
                in.</p>
            <p>These shifts are required in business sometimes. A new type of company or invention will become
                part of the way of thinking, generally, and then new developments need to break through this and
                help a shift occur. It&rsquo;s hard work!</p>
            <p class="link-new-tab">Investopedia: <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"

            <p>The first business that comes along to create chewing gum for example, has to get everyone to buy
                their product. They market and sell and everyone thinks this is a fun new product. Success. But
                a new company comes along and thinks maybe liquid chewing gum might work. People could buy a
                tube of gum and just pop as much as they wanted to chew on for a while. This is a much harder
                job. Everyone accepts that gum is a solid. Everyone knows where you can buy a packet. To sell a
                new item, stores have to support the sale, and initially it will be limited. So will
                manufacturing. Until the item is popular enough, this is going to be made in a smaller scale
                than the regular gum. People are also already so used to their solid gum, they don&rsquo;t want
                to change.</p>

            <p>But we know that we can change. We accepted email over letter writing. We go to supermarkets
                instead of the greengrocer, butcher and general store. And we learned to stand 1.5m from each
                other in public.</p>

                    social media is a paradigm shift, how far have you shifted?</a></p>
            <p>Our biggest challenge at SecureCash is the generally accepted notion that cash collections must
                be an operation conducted by armed people in uniforms with marked cars. Everyone knows they
                can&rsquo;t use their guns to protect your cash, but they seem to accept that they must pay for
                the gun to be there. Everyone accepts the logo on the truck makes it a moving target, yet they
                prefer to use that vehicle. Our covert services are somehow seen as something inferior, or not
                as secure for some reason.</p>
            <p class="link-new-tab"><a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;"
                    href="https://www.securecash.com.au">https://www.securecash.com.au/</a></p>
            <p>But there are even more subtle changes that need to occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I talk to so many clients that think you have to order rolls of coin, pre-rolled in
                    particularamounts. Nothing is further from the truth. They don&rsquo;t realise until we tell
                    them that they can order however many coins they need. The pre-existing paradigm tells them
                    they have to pay for $50 of coin when they only want $18 and can order and pay that much
                    alone.</li>
                <li>Even the pre-existing idea that the money has to be counted off site by the courier before
                    being deposited, and paying for wages for that to occur has to be corrected. There is no
                    need to recount the money you need to deposit. You&rsquo;ve counted it. The bank is going to
                    count it. Why pay a third party to count it again?</li>
                <li>Potential clients ask me how much it costs to roll the coin. How much for each paper, or the
                    time for rolling...I don&rsquo;t even know what they are asking for half the time. They are
                    so convinced they need this service. That&rsquo;s what the existing paradigm told them.</li>
                <li>What about the loss of bank staff? The paradigm is so ingrained in the banking system, they
                    don&rsquo;t count the money anymore. They send it to the armed service to count on their
                    behalf (I assume paying them for this service), and therefore do not need staff in the bank
                    to provide the service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Making the shift somehow seems like an insurmountable job. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it should
                be this hard to tell society to save their money and make the process simpler. It doesn&rsquo;t
                have to be so complicated. Complicated = expensive. Clearly the shift IS underway if the armed
                service providers now offer our covert services (albeit still more expensively). They have seen
                that the simpler way is better for the customer and that the client can be much happier with
                massive savings.</p>
            <p>So the bigger parts of the paradigm are shifting. It&rsquo;s the smaller details we need to get
                over the line so that the entire process can be something that keeps clients happy. That&rsquo;s
                the only reason we are here. If we can save our clients money, make the process simple, digitise
                the whole thing so they can track their money in real time, they stay with us.</p>
            <p>Paradigms are hard to establish, but even harder to shift to new processes. It takes a lot of
                time for changes to become generally accepted. And if there is competition keeping you from
                having the paradigm shifted, even harder again. Fitting our lives into paradigms has become
                habit. Everyone does what is socially expected. We go to work, raise families and try to be the
                best version of ourselves possible. It has become more acceptable to tell people you might be
                struggling with these concepts, and that you are not meeting your paradigm. Having your best
                support network helps you reach, or change, your paradigm. Stop and think if you&rsquo;re in
                need of a paradigm shift.</p>
            <p>Above everything we must remember that the shifting might come with some discomfort. Not every
                change is welcomed with open arms. There will be resistance, and a lot of the time there will be
                people actively working against you.</p>

    content: `<p>Cash in transit is a broad term that has evolved through the years. But mainly, it is widely
                defined as the secure transport of business takings from one location to another.</p>
            <p>When you&rsquo;re new to the cash-in-transit industry, you&rsquo;ll encounter jargons or
                unfamiliar terminologies that can be quite difficult to differentiate. It is important to
                understand these words to avoid confusion in the workplace. We&rsquo;ll break down some common
                terms to help you understand what type of services best meet your requirements.</p>

    content: `<p>I was at the chemist, post-Covid, and their power was out. Customers queued outside while the
                staff used the torches from their phones to light merchandise and bring it to the counter for
                purchases. We could hand cash over to them, or enter the store, one at a time, to pay. Cash
                only. Their inventory app was not able to log any items removed from shelves for their
                restocking. The cash registers were open, and we could use cash to buy things. If you only had a
                card for electronic purchases, you had to go somewhere else, or come back later. Luckily for me,
                I work in cash. I can use my card to purchase at a location with no cash option, but I avoid
                those anyway.</p>
            <p>At Christmas 2019 this occurred on a much larger scale when all Myer stores in Australia had a
                technical issue and no cash registers for over 3 hours. I&rsquo;m not even sure if they thought
                to take cash instead of card at the time. But it sounds like most people ended up having to do
                their Christmas shopping elsewhere.</p>
            <p>After Hurricane Maria in 2019 Puerto Rico had a slow climb back to normality. With electricity a
                major issue at the time, or lack thereof, as well as no telecommunications, banks were basically
                closed for business. After a few weeks, most were reopened, but not all. Giant cash shipments
                had been sent to ensure the cash-based economy had enough notes to survive.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, with the tightening Covid restrictions and complete uncertainty surrounding
                the pandemic and severity, cash hoarding became a thing. Through March there were increased
                withdrawals of cash as a precautionary measure. Some withdrawals, mind you, ran into the
                millions of dollars.</p>

            <p>A survey in May found nearly 40 percent of respondents held cash in their wallets. However, lower
                income households and people over 65 tended to use cash more than cards to make payments and
                purchases. Nearly half of all purchases under $10 are paid with cash. There are so many extra
                fees involved that vendors don&rsquo;t always want to pass those fees onto customers and ask for
                minimum EFTPOS amounts instead.</p>

                    crisis sparks large bank withdrawals, despite looming cash transaction ban</a></p>
            <p>According to a 7 News report from back in February, before Covid fears had us all going cashless,
                with the rise of tap-and-go options, Australians could be paying approximately $460 in bank
                fees. Between credit and debit card fees and EFTPOS, every single coffee, Maccas run, or
                newspaper is costing you. Our ability to use PayWave or PayPass to simply tap-and-go, has
                charges that the vendor must pay. It is then up to the vendor if they wish to pass this charge
                onto customers and risk them attending an opposing vendor instead. This is where it can be very
                tricky for smaller businesses to swallow the costs of providing cashless options for their
                clients. Larger corporations are able to afford these charges without having to pass them on. In
                some cases however, large chains do still pass the credit surcharge onto customers, often
                leading to online commentary now that everyone is able to leave ratings and reviews for almost
                every action they undertake.</p>

            <p>There was also found to be only approximately 25 percent of the $80 billion worth of cash in
                circulation was used by households and businesses for everyday transactions. That leaves roughly
                $60 billion being held, just in case. This is not just an Australian concern. Digital wallets
                such as Paytm have become increasingly popular in India, however most Indians still rely on
                cash.</p>
            <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has even reported an increase in printing of $50 and $100 notes
                since the beginning of 2020. $100 notes printing has increased 10% and the $50 notes have
                resulted in an increased print of $7.5 billion since the end of January.</p>

            <p>Cashless societies may not be the answer. 70% of Australians oppose a cashless society, citing
                network outages and increased merchant fees as being cons the pro column cannot overcome. Many
                Australians tend to tap-and-go recently, however with the previously mentioned 40% of Australian
                having cash on hand, it is surprising to hear so many more would not support a cashless society.
                It may be a remnant of ATMs origins when there were many stories of cash not dispensed when
                requested late one night. It may be a response to complete government control of your finances.
                For whatever reason, that seven out of ten people would prefer to have money available means
                cash will always be king.</p>

                    shun cash in 2020, but 70% still oppose a cashless society</a></p>
            <p>We can also learn from countries that tried previously to eradicate cash. Burma in 1987, the
                (former) Soviet Union in 1991, and North Korea in 2009 all had to face riots and violence. The
                attempt to remove cash from society has always led to hunger and complaints. India attempted to
                remove and replace their 500 and 1000 rupee notes in 2016. This led to incredibly long lines at
                banks as everyone tried to swap the old notes for new ones. Black money was the catalyst for
                this replacement, and the attempt to catch out tax evaders prompted nearly $US320 billion in
                notes (roughly 86%) of the cash in circulation to be made redundant overnight. After huge
                financial losses, no eradication of black money, and the immense cost of printing the new notes,
                this exercise did seem a lesson in what not to do.</p>

            <p>It does seem as though cashless societies are what governments would prefer. Banks look to
                diversify their products to remain viable. And from the sounds of it, people want cash. There
                isn&rsquo;t likely to be an answer soon. However, the increasingly cashless options that Covid
                prompted, does highlight the willingness of people to use less cash. But this looks like
                it&rsquo;s a temporary fix that is only there to address the fear of virus transmission.</p>

    content: `<p>Our business is unique in that we change our procedures often. We develop our procedures in
        response to our clients feedback and input. We hire new staff pretty regularly as we grow. And
        we have to learn new tasks that help our own positions as those requirements evolve. I would
        think that should be true of any business. They aim to grow and they aim to adapt.</p>
    <p>But the changes we all went through last year with Covid were massive. Personally I became a
        tradie for my company for a few months, then took on new roles. We reverted to something
        resembling normal around September, and by Christmas were operating at our previous levels.</p>
    <p>For our company, being couriers supporting businesses that had to remain open, work never
        stopped. Luckily. We all know essential services had to remain operational. But what about
        everyone else?</p>
    <p>Working from home became the thing to do. It was safe, it guaranteed your business could stay
        afloat, and employees would not struggle. What happened to those that then had to learn to Zoom
        for meetings, and control their tendencies to procrastinate? Everyone back in the offices now
        had to go back to face to face meetings. Travel time to appointments. And bosses peering over
        your shoulder to stop all that procrastinating. Hopefully it didn&rsquo;t take too long to get
        back into the habits of work.</p>
    <p>But we know we can do this! We are resilient. We are fighters. If we are told things are going to
        be a bit tougher, we knuckle down. We know we can overcome anything.</p>

    <p>Did you learn new tasks during lockdown? Did you pick up a new hobby while under isolation? From
        what I could hear online while everyone else was forced to remain at home, so many people picked
        up new skills. Linkedin Learning became a valuable resource, for those looking to reskill for
        new employment opportunities, or for anyone wanting to fill in the boredom.</p>
    <p>As everything went online, the companies that already had online down pat excelled. They ended up
        with massive numbers of people training, learning and growing. It had such a positive effect on
        everyone that undertook training. They could come out of isolation knowing they were a better
        person than they were going into it.</p>
    <p>Our communication skills are certainly better. I for one had to learn how to hold my head higher
        during online meetings. Video is not kind to older women! And making sure there were adequate,
        quiet spaces in your house for calling became a family affair. I placed signs on doors and told
        my kids they couldn&rsquo;t enter until I came out. (The first video call may have included two
        of my three kids.) Now, I only had a handful of video calls, meetings, or even guest speaker
        roles. For those that had to do this multiple times per day, they bring back to the office an
        ability to multitask and schedule they may not have had previously.</p>
    <p>I have no doubt that we all came back to work upskilled. With the unemployment rate soaring,
        these skills will help. It has become necessary to add to the number or skills on your resume.
        Your CV has to now include things the potential employer didn&rsquo;t even know they wanted.</p>
    <p>There was also lots of talk online about companies that did not return to full time office
        contact. We were so jealous! People would get to spend time with their families, avoid traffic,
        and wake up that little later to start their day. Unilever is trialling a four day working week
        in New Zealand. Microsoft&rsquo;s trial in Japan last August of a four day week was very
        successful. And with CEO&rsquo;s and GM&rsquo;s seeing how much can still be accomplished by
        employees working remotely, this may be the push to change what our working week looks like.</p>

    <p>Most of the population may have returned to their offices, and quite a lot of them with more
        skills than before. But Covid left a lasting impression on everyone. From those that lost loved
        ones to the virus, to the people that had mental health concerns and didn&rsquo;t cope that well
        with isolation. Every single person on the planet has been affected. And every single one of
        those people have come out of 2020 stronger than they entered into it.</p>
