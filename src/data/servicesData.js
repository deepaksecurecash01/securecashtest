To do this, they outsource their banking tasks to cash-in-transit companies who <a href='cash-transport-companies/'>transport money</a> using an armoured car service. But how safe is your money in the hands of these couriers?`,
              `<a href='https://editions.covecollective.org/chronologies/armored-car#:~:text=This%20war%20machine%20designed%20by,the%20enemy%20from%20all%20angles.'>The first concept of armoured vehicles</a> can be traced back in the year 1485 by Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches consisting of a circular platform on four wheels with light cannons positioned facing out. However, the design was later proved to be flawed.`,
              `Through the years, due to invention and consistent innovations, armoured cars and CIT trucks have become what they are today. Some armoured cars have bulletproof body frames, while other vehicles only have bulletproofed windscreens.`,
              `<strong>What makes SecureCash different from other cash security service providers?</strong> As a covert cash security provider, <em>we do not use armoured car or trucks during our operations. And it’s not our big secret—never was.</em>`,

              `An armoured truck parked outside your building is an obvious representation of you having <a href='cash-logistic-services/'>large amounts of cash being moved</a>. It also advertises the fact that you may have more money kept inside. By seeing the armoured vehicle and its uniformed crew, this would cause suspicion and invite ideas for thieves and robbers to plot a crime: they can note down routines, patterns, record time and date of transport. If they will not consider robbing the armoured van, they can certainly be organizing a scheme to break into your office anytime.`,
              `By using regular and unmarked vehicles, we can simply act as a visitor or just one of the customers. This allows us to stay under the radar while we assess the location, perform our tasks, and move your money freely without compromising your work.`,

With this method, our couriers cannot be followed and our collection patterns are much harder to study and analyze. We want to be able to perform our duties in a less noticeable way as possible, with less impact, and no disruptions in your office environment—just smooth hassle-free cash transport solutions.`,
              `Another plus point in choosing SecureCash is—you won't have to worry about your money while in transit.
